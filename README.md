# JElox Language

Changing from JElox to J-ren 🦸‍♂️

A very simple ***dynamically-types*** programming language 🌩️

### The inspiration?
This project is my implementation of the jLox programming language covered in the book Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom 📔

### Current status...
This project is largely unfinished, we're at the foot of the mountain: **The Tokenizer** 🗺️⛰️

Feel free to contribute 🪄
